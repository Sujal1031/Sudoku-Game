Sudoku Master: Math Hint Edition is a classic number puzzle game built using Python's Tkinter GUI library. The game offers three difficulty levels—Easy, Medium, and Hard—and challenges players to complete a 9x9 Sudoku grid. What sets this version apart is the unique hint system: players can unlock up to 3 hints by solving simple math problems, making the gameplay both educational and entertaining. The interface is user-friendly with a clean design and color scheme inspired by natural skin tones. This project is ideal for students learning Python, especially those exploring object-oriented programming and GUI development.
